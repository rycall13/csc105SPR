            <h2>Why Volleyball is Amazing</h2>
            <p>Volleyball is a sport that promotes teamwork, communication, and agility. Whether played on the beach or indoors, it brings people together and keeps them active.</p>
            <p>The game is played with six players on each team, aiming to send the ball over the net and land it in the opponentâ€™s court while preventing them from doing the same.</p>
            <p>Volleyball consists of passing, setting, and hitting. If it all gets done consistently, you find yourself winning in no time!</p>
